## Overview
Get even more comfortable with React by creating your own shopping experience! You can choose any theme for the site but it should be a basic implementation of an e-commerce interface. 

## Steps
1. Fork this repository
2. cd into this repository. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to launch the web app locally
4. If you get an error saying: Module not found: Can't resolve '<MODULE_NAME>' in '<LOCAL_PATH>', `cd` into `node_modules` and run `npm install <MODULE_NAME>`. Keep doing this until you get rid of all the errors. 
5. When you are done, deploy it on heroku following our deployment guide. Ignore the cs1300 template - you'll be deploying this git repo.
